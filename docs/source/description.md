# Description

In this reference design, each port of the [Ethernet FMC] is connected to an AXI Ethernet Subsystem IP
which is connected to the system memory via an AXI DMA IP.

## Hardware Platforms

The hardware designs provided in this reference are based on Vivado and support a range of FPGA and MPSoC evaluation
boards. The repository contains all necessary scripts and code to build these designs for the supported platforms listed below:

{% for group in data.groups %}
    {% set designs_in_group = [] %}
    {% for design in data.designs %}
        {% if design.group == group.label and design.publish %}
            {% set _ = designs_in_group.append(design.label) %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    {% if designs_in_group | length > 0 %}
### {{ group.name }} platforms

| Target board        | FMC Slot Used | Supported<br>Num. Ports   | Standalone<br> Echo Server | PetaLinux |
|---------------------|---------------|---------|-----|-----|
{% for design in data.designs %}{% if design.group == group.label and design.publish %}| [{{ design.board }}]({{ design.link }}) | {{ design.connector }} | {{ design.lanes | length }}x | {% if design.baremetal %} ✅ {% else %} ❌ {% endif %} | {% if design.petalinux %} ✅ {% else %} ❌ {% endif %} |
{% endif %}{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Software

These reference designs can be driven by either a standalone application or within a PetaLinux environment. 
The repository includes all necessary scripts and code to build both environments. The table 
below outlines the corresponding applications available in each environment:

| Environment      | Available Applications  |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Standalone       | lwIP Echo Server |
| PetaLinux        | Built-in Linux commands<br>Additional tools: ethtool, phytool, iperf3 |
