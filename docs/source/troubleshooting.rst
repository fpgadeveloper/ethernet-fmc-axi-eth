Troubleshooting
===============

Check the following if the project fails to build or generate a bitstream:

1. **Are you using the correct version of Vivado for this version of the repository?**
   Check the version specified in the Requirements section of the README.md file. Note that this project is regularly maintained to the latest
   version of Vivado and you may have to refer to an earlier commit of this repo if you are using an older version of Vivado.

2. **Did you correctly follow the Build instructions in this readme file?**
   All the projects in the repo are built, synthesised and implemented to a bitstream before being committed, so if you follow the
   instructions, there should not be any build issues.

3. **Did you copy/clone the repo into a short directory structure?**
   Vivado doesn't cope well with long directory structures, so copy/clone the repo into a short directory structure such as
   ``C:\projects\``. When working in long directory structures, you can get errors relating to missing files, particularly files 
   that are normally generated by Vivado (FIFOs, etc).
